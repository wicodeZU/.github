## I want to be a member what should I do

Talk to our [moderators](#our-moderators) for your request. One of them will get to you as soon as they see your request. Beware that Github doesn't have a direct messaging feature, so you would have to look at ways to contact the moderators. You can navigate to their profile and see if they have a social media account or an email. If they don't then you may have to use [other ways](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12686545/how-to-leave-a-message-for-a-github-com-user) of communication.  
Just be respectful in whatever you do. They have their own [personal life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life) to attend to.

## Nobody responded to my requests

As said earlier the our moderators have a personal life. Be patient and they'll get back to you. If nobody gets back to you within a reasonably amount of time _(like a month or so)_ then you can try opening an issue and tagging them or you could learn the [art of patience](https://time.com/6095843/learning-patience/) while waiting or [do nothing](https://time.com/45995/want-to-succeed-you-should-seriously-consider-do-nothing/)!

## I want to support you financially

You can use [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) to sponsor your favourite developer. If you can't use github sponsor for some reasons, please contact the developer you want to support directly so that they can tell you another way if available.

## I'm new to tech

Congratulations on your journey. If you need any assistance you can contact the [moderators](#our-moderators) who can point you in the right direction. Don't forget to follow them on their social media platforms like [@twitter](https://twitter.com) to see their tweets and engage with them more often.
